# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of various data science and machine learning projects. Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a Jupyter notebook with the code and analysis, as well as a `README.md` file explaining the project.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

-   [**A1_pandas_adult_dataset.ipynb**](A1_pandas_adult_dataset.ipynb): A project that involves data analysis on the Adult Census Income dataset using the pandas library.

-   [**California-Housing-Prices**](California-Housing-Prices/): A project to predict California housing prices using machine learning regression techniques.

-   [**Fake-News-Classifier**](Fake-News-Classifier/): A project to build a model that classifies news articles as real or fake, likely using NLP and deep learning techniques.

-   [**Generating Keywords for Google Ads**](Generating%20Keywords%20for%20Google%20Ads/): A project that demonstrates how to programmatically generate targeted keywords for a Google Ads campaign.

-   [**IPL-Auction-EDA**](IPL-Auction-EDA/): An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 auction data.

-   [**MNIST-SKlearn**](MNIST-SKlearn/): A project to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various models from the `scikit-learn` library.

-   [**Netflix_Projects**](Netflix_Projects/): An analysis of Netflix movie data to investigate the trend of declining movie durations.

-   [**NumPy_practice**](NumPy_practice/): A Jupyter notebook with examples and exercises for learning the NumPy library.

-   [**Spaceship-Titanic-**](Spaceship-Titanic-/): A project for the Kaggle "Spaceship Titanic" competition to predict which passengers were transported to another dimension.

-   [**Titanic-ml**](Titanic-ml/): The classic Kaggle competition to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.

## Usage

Each project directory contains a `README.md` with specific details on how to run the project and any dependencies required. In general, you will need Python and Jupyter Notebook installed, along with common data science libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.

To get started with a project:
1.  Navigate to the project's directory.
2.  Read the `README.md` file for instructions.
3.  Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells.
