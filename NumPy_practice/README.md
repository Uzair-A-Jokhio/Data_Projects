# NumPy Practice

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with examples and exercises for practicing with the NumPy library in Python. It's designed for beginners who are getting started with NumPy.

## Notebook: `_array.ipynb`

The `_array.ipynb` notebook covers the fundamental concepts of NumPy, focusing on array creation and manipulation.

### Topics Covered
- **Creating NumPy Arrays:**
  - 1-D arrays
  - 2-D arrays
  - 3-D arrays
- **Array Attributes:**
  - Checking the number of dimensions of an array using the `.ndim` attribute.
  - Creating an array with a specific number of dimensions using the `ndmin` parameter.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to provide a hands-on environment for learning and experimenting with the core features of the NumPy library.

## Dependencies
- `numpy`

You can install NumPy using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Usage
Open and run the `_array.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment to go through the examples and try out the code.
