# Spaceship Titanic

This repository contains a data science project for the Kaggle "Spaceship Titanic" competition. The goal is to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system.

## Project Overview

This project involves:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset through visualizations and statistical summaries.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, feature engineering, and preparing the data for machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning:** Building and evaluating predictive models to solve the classification problem.

## Notebook

The main work is done in the `space-titanic.ipynb` notebook. It includes all the steps from data loading and cleaning to model building and evaluation.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have the required datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) in the same directory.
3. Open and run the `space-titanic.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
