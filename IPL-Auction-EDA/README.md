# IPL 2023 Auction - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset from the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 auction. The goal is to uncover insights and trends from the auction data.

## Project Overview

The notebook `ipl-2023-auction-eda.ipynb` contains a detailed analysis of the IPL 2023 auction. The EDA aims to answer questions like:
- Who were the most expensive players?
- Which teams spent the most money?
- What is the distribution of players by country?
- What is the distribution of player roles (batsman, bowler, all-rounder, wicket-keeper)?
- Is there a correlation between a player's base price and their final selling price?

## Process

The notebook uses standard data science libraries to:
1. Load and clean the IPL 2023 auction dataset.
2. Perform statistical analysis to summarize the data.
3. Create various visualizations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots) to present the findings in an easy-to-understand format.

## Dependencies
